    - Added Hook enabling `python -m qats app` as an equivalent to `qats app` (the entry point executable).
    - Added `config` option `--link-app-no-exe` that generates Windows Start menu shortcut utilizing the new CLI hook (instead of entry point executable).
- `qats.stats.weibull`: added Weibull distribution tail-fitting using least squares (`qats.stats.weibull.lse()`). [PR [#104](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/104)]
  
### Fixed

- Support for reading wind turbine key-files (`key_<>_witurb.txt`) exported from SIMA/RIFLEX version >=4.20 (where wind turbine name is included in a column to the left of time series name). [issue [#97](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/issues/97)]
- `TimeSeries.minima()` threshold error. [issue [#95](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/issues/95)]

## [4.10.0] // 25.05.2022

Time series can now be exported to SIMA HDF5 format. Errors are no longer raised when having timeseries from different drives in the same time series database.

## [4.9.2] // 03.12.2020

Corrected `npTDMS` version requirement in `setup.py`.

## [4.9.1] // 03.12.2020

Updated `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` to latest versions of dependencies.


## [4.9.0] // 18.11.2020

This release contains pull request [#79](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/79).

### Added

- [GUI] Statistics table may is now sorted in ascending/descending order when column header is clicked. The sorting order is reset when 'Display' is invoked.
- [GUI] Added setting that controls number of decimals in time window for data processing.
- `TsDB.stats_dataframe()`: new method that returns statistics in a Pandas dataframe with same structure and behaviour as the dict returned from `TsDB.stats()`.
- `qats.readers.sima`: Added support for wind turbine output from SIMA/RIFLEX, i.e. reading of `<prefix>_witurb.bin` and `<prefix>_blresp.bin`.

### Fixed
- `TsDB.stats()`: default value of parameter `statsdur` is set to 10800 [s] instead of `None`. Previously failed if this parameter was not passed, since the underlying function `TimeSeries.stats()` did not accept/handle `None`. 
- `qats.readers.tdms`: Changed how tdms-files are opened and avoid number of obsolete iterations when inferring the time array to improve the performance of the tdms-reader.


## [4.8.1] // 08.06.2020

This release contains the following pull requests: [#74](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/74), [#76](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/76), [#77](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/77).

### Fixed

- `qats.readers.sima_h5`: Time step of generated time array is now checked towards the specified time step with a (very small) tolerance. Previously, the generated time step was required to exactly match the specified one, but in certain cases this failed due to numpy precision.
- `qats.readers.tdms`: Removes dependencies on deprecated features in the `nptdms` library.
- `qats.TimeSeries`: Now handles time as an array of `numpy.datetime64` objects.
- `requirements.txt`: Sphinx updated from 2.2.1 to 3.0.4 _(security update, relevant for maintainers only)_.


## [4.8.0] // 10.04.2020

This release contains the two following pull requests: [#67](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/67), [#72](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/72).

### Added

- New reader for .tdms files (Technical Data Management Streaming - file format used by LabVIEW), based on the `npTDMS` module.
- New dependency to `npTDMS`; https://pypi.org/project/npTDMS/.

### Fixed

- Improved compatibility with special characters, such as accents etc. when reading data from CSV files; ref. [#69](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/issues/69).
- Improved compatibility for various data types (integer, numpy.int64 etc.) when initiating `TimeSeries` instance; ref. [#71](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/issues/71).
- Fixed bug causing time series names to vanish when exporting single time series to file; ref. [#70](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/issues/70).


## [4.7.0] // 15.01.2020

### Added
Three functions have been added to submodule `qats.signal`:

- `qats.signal.csd()`: Estimate cross power spectral density of discrete-time signals X and Y using Welch’s method.
- `qats.signal.coherence()`: Estimate the magnitude squared coherence estimate of discrete-time signals X and Y using Welch’s method.
- `qats.signal.tfe()`: Estimate the transfer function between two discrete-time signals X and Y using Welch’s method.

For details, see the [API documentation](https://qats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/qats/submodules.html#module-qats.signal). Note that these new functions are all wrappers for relevant functions available from `scipy.signal`.

### Changed
There are significant changes to subpackage `qats.fatigue`, and in particular for the `qats.fatigue.rainflow` module. Most changes are related to performance for large cycle distributions, and the output type is changed from `list` to `numpy.ndarray` for several of the functions. This allows for adjusted syntax, however; the changes are backwards compatible in the sense that the old syntax will still work. For function `qats.fatigue.rainflow.mesh()`, the mesh returned deviates from the mesh calculated for version <= 4.6.1 (mesh calculated for these versions was not correct).

Main changes are as follows:

- `qats.fatigue.sn`: `SNCurve.n()` now accepts float or array as input, and returns the same type as the input (float or array). `minersum()` is updated to utilize this, performing array operation instead of time consuming list comprehension (with multiple calls to `SNCurve.n()`).

- `qats.fatigue.sn.minersum()` is now more flexible wrt. the `sn` input parameter. Three different data types are accepted: 1) a dict; in this case the dict is used to initiate an `SNCurve` instance (as before), 2) a class instance; in this case the object is expected to have a callable method `n()` (as before, but more flexible wrt. type of class instance), 3) a callable (a function); the function must accept stress ranges as the first positional argument. Parameters `args` and `kwds` are introduced to enable forwarding of arguments to the callable - this is relevant for alt. 2) (when instance passed is not `SNCurve`) and alt. 3).

- `qats.fatigue.rainflow.count_cycles()` now returns a numpy array with shape `(n, 3)`, whereas previously it return a list of 3-tuples. `n` is here the number of cycles and half cycles. Unpacking may now be done as `r, m, c = count_cycles(series).T`, which is much faster for large `n` than the old syntax `r, m, c = zip(*count_cycles(series)`. The latter may still be used however, hence this change is backwards compatible. A minor change from qats version <= 4.6.1 is that the count is now always either 1.0 (full cycles) or 0.5 (half cycles). Matching cycles (same range and mean) are no longer matched with increased count, but rather included as individual cycles. This is of no importance at all, except that the return array may be longer in some few cases (however; sum of the counts, i.e. the sum of the 3rd column, is unchanged).

- `qats.fatigue.rainflow.rebin()` now returns a numpy array similar to that returned from `count_cycles()`. Rebinning is now done by use of [`np.histogram()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html), which significantly increases the speed. A minor change from qats version <= 4.6.1 is that cycles ranges (or means) that end up on the edge of a bin is placed in the highest bin. This is more conservative, and in most cases there will be no difference at all (since very few cycles will normally coincide with bin edges).

- `qats.fatigue.rainflow.mesh()`: mesh established for qats version <= 4.6.1 is not correct. The function is now re-written, using  [`np.histogram2d()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram2d.html) and  [`np.meshgrid()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html). For further details about the properties of the mesh established, see the function docstring or the [API documentation](https://qats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/qats/subpackages/fatigue.html#qats.fatigue.rainflow.mesh).

- `qats.fatigue.corrections.goodman_haigh()` now accepts (and returns) np.ndarray, and utilizes this for efficiency. See docstring or [API documentation](https://qats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/qats/subpackages/fatigue.html#qats.fatigue.corrections.goodman_haigh) for details and an example.


## [4.6.1] // 26.11.2019

### Fixed
- Catch and log KeyError occuring when trying to load the same time series file twice.
- Make the displayed time series names uneditable


## [4.6.0] // 14.11.2019

### Added
New reader for SINTEF Ocean data exchange format based on Matlab .mat files. It now supports all .mat file format versions <=7.3.

`TsDB` has a new attribute `uuid` with a universally unique identifier.

`TsDB` now supports length, membership and equality operations like:
```python
from qats import TsDB
db = TsDB.fromfile('data.csv')
db_two = TsDB()
len(db)
# output: 14
'ts_a_name' in db
# output: True
db_two == db
# output: False
 ```

### Changed

The file format previously referred to as Matlab files is now more precisely described as the data exchange format used by SINTEF Ocean. The submodule `qats.readers.matlab` has been renamed to `qats.readers.sintef_mat`. _Note: for backwards compatibilty, the submodule is still available as `qats.readers.matlab` due to aliased import at `qats.readers` level._

The `__repr__` and `__str__` methods on the `TsDB` class are improved to better serve their indented purposes, respectively: unambiguous and readable.

Previously iteration of a `TsDB` instance would return `None` for those time series which data was **not** loaded from file. Now iteration return `TimeSeries` instances for those time series which data has been loaded from file and skip the other.

Updated the package and environment requirements.

### Fixed
Prevent error raised when the env. variable `APPDATA` does not exist.

## [4.5.0] // 05.11.2019

### Added

File menu action that clears the logger widget. Hot key `Ctrl+Shift+Del`.

### Fixed

A bug that caused the time series tooltip to only display the time series' relative path, not the absolute path.


## [4.4.0] // 04.11.2019

### Added

`qats.fatigue.rainflow` module:

- Introduced a new optional parameter `endpoints` (bool) to functions `reversals()`, `cycles()` and `cycle_counting()`. If set to True, first and last points in series passed are included as cycle start/end points. This is convenient if the series passed is already an array of reversal points, but should in general not be used otherwise. Default is `endpoints=False`, which gives the same behavior as before.

`.plot_*()` methods of `TimeSeries` and `TsDB` classes (for background and more details, see [issue #55](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/issues/55)):

- Introduced optional parameter `num`, to control `matplotlib.pyplot` figure number.
- Introduced optional parameter `show` (bool), to control whether `pyplot.show()` is invoked or not.
- `.plot_cycle_range()`: introduced optional parameter `bw`, to control bar width.

### Fixed

- `TimeSeries.stats()`: `np.nan` is inserted for statistical values that cannot be calculated (e.g. Weibull parameters if fit fails).
- Desktop application (GUI), statistics tab: fixed issues related to clearing the table, updating when Weibull fit fails and mismatch between values and table heading. For details, see [issue #58](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/issues/58).


## [4.3.0] // 30.10.2019

### Added
The desktop application now:
- Has a separate tab with tabulated time series statistics. The statistics can be copied to clipboard.
- Enable user configuration of certain settings. The settings are saved between sessions.

### Changed
The library now uses Scipy IIR filters instead of the self-made filters. Mainly to improve handling of edge effects and to simplify maintenance.

Restructured the functions for calculating power spectral density. *Note: The desktop application now apply a default segment length of 1000 points when estimating power spectral density using Welch's method. This can be adjusted in the application settings dialog. Previously the default segment length was 1/4 of the signal length.*

## [4.2.0] // 23.09.2019

### Changed
Replaced hard dependency on `PyQt5` with `QtPy`, due to `PyQt5`'s strong copyleft GPL license. `QtPy` is a shim over various Qt bindings such as: `PyQt4`, `PyQt5`, `Pyside` and `Pyside2`. The user must now install the preferred binding himself/herself, in order to use the GUI.

Note: If several qt bindings are installed (e.g. `PyQt5` and `Pyside2`), the environmental variable `QT_API` may be used to control which binding is used. See https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/ for details.

## [4.1.1] // 17.09.2019

### Fixed
- `qats.signal.psd()`: sampling frequency `fs` in the [welch function call](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/blob/3378ea5972f1cd56a23a902397d195f03c0f8db2/qats/signal.py#L692) corrected to `fs=1./dt` (instead of `fs=dt` which was wrong). This error appeared between versions [4.0.1 and 4.1.0](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/compare/4.0.1...4.1.0), and also affected `TimeSeries.psd()` and the "Power Spectrum" plot tab in the GUI. 
- `TimeSeries.plot*()` methods: plot label is now set to time series name, to avoid warning when legends are invoked.

### Added
Four new tests on `qats.signal.psd()` that would have caught the bug described above.

## [4.1.0] // 28.08.2019

### Added
- `qats.signal.psd()`: power spectral density calculation (now available as detached function, was previously available only through `TimeSeries.psd()`).
- `test_readers.py`: new test module for loading (reading) all supported file formats.
- `test_signal.py`: added more tests for `qats.signal` functions.


## [4.0.1] // 23.08.2019

### Fixed
- SIMA .h5 reader bug that occured if numpy 1.16 is used.
- `qats.cli.launch_app()` did not connect `sys.excepthook` with custom error traceback dialogue.


## [4.0.0] // 22.08.2019

This release is not backwards compatible. Main updates are related to fatigue calculation capabilities.

### Added
- New sub-package `qats.fatigue` for fatigue-related modules. 
  Modules in this sub-package: `corrections` (new), `rainflow` (moved), `sncalc` (new)
- New sub-package `qats.stats` for modules with statistical distributions. 
  Modules in this sub-package: `empirical` (moved + new name), `gumbel` (moved), `gumbelmin` (moved), `weibull` (moved)
- Rainflow counting algorithm now also extracts mean value of cycles (see `qats.fatigue.rainflow.cycles()` and `.count_cycles()`).
- Class method `TsDB.getl()` ("get list").
- New module `motions.py`, for transformations and operations related to motion time series.
- Changelog (this file)

### Changed
- Sub-module `rainflow` moved into sub-package `qats.fatigue` => `qats.fatigue.rainflow`
- Sub-modules `gumbel`, `gumbelmin` and `weibull` moved into sub-package `qats.stats` => `qats.fatigue.`
- Sub-module `stats` renamed to `empirical` and moved into sub-package `qats.stats` => `qats.stats.empirical`
- Documentation updated with new API reference structure.
- Changed `TsDB.getd()` method ("get dict") to return dict of `TimeSeries` objects, which is identical to `TsDB.getm()`. 
  For previous functionality of `.getd()`, use `TsDB.getda()` ("get dict of arrays").

### Fixed
- Wildcard prepending to names specified to `TsDB.list()` and `TsDB.get*()` methods. 
  See [this summary](https://github.com/dnvgl/qats/pull/28#issue-296526900) for details.


## [3.0.6] // 2019-06-27

### Fixed
- Issues related to proper deployment to PyPI and Read the Docs.
- Bug when using band-stop filter in GUI.


## [3.0.5] // 2019-06-26
